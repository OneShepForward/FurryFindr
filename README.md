FurryFindr is a full-stack web app using ReactJS on the frontend and Ruby with ActiveRecord and Sinatra on the backend. It was a paired programming project during the Flatiron School Software Engineering course.

The idea behind FurryFindr was a Tinder-esque app to match people with pets to adopt. Here's hoping you find a nice pet to swipe right on!
